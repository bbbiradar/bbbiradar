>> lsblk

Identify the EBS volume you want to mount based on its size and device name (e.g., /dev/xvdf).

If the EBS volume is not formatted, you need to format it with a file system. For example, to format it with the ext4 file system, use the following command:


>> sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf

Note: Replace "/dev/xvdf" with the appropriate device name for your EBS volume.

Create a directory as the mount point for the EBS volume. For example:


>> sudo mkdir /mnt/myebsvolume

You can choose any directory path as per your preference.

Mount the EBS volume to the created directory using the following command:


>> sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/myebsvolume

Again, replace "/dev/xvdf" with the appropriate device name for your EBS volume.

Verify that the EBS volume is mounted successfully by listing the contents of the mount point directory:


>> ls /mnt/myebsvolume

You should see the contents of the mounted EBS volume.

To ensure that the EBS volume is automatically mounted when the EC2 instance is rebooted, you can add an entry to the /etc/fstab file. Open the file using a text editor:


>> sudo nano /etc/fstab

Add the following entry at the end of the file:


>> /dev/xvdf    /mnt/myebsvolume    ext4    defaults,nofail    0    2

Save the file and exit the text editor.

Now your EBS volume is mounted to the specified directory in the Linux EC2 instance. It will be automatically mounted whenever the EC2 instance is rebooted.



Command explaination 


>> lsblk: This command lists all the block devices attached to the system. It helps you identify the device name of the EBS volume you want to mount.

>> sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf: The mkfs command is used to create a file system on a device. In this case, it formats the EBS volume specified by /dev/xvdf with the ext4 file system. Adjust the device name (/dev/xvdf) to match the actual device you want to format.

>> sudo mkdir /mnt/myebsvolume: This command creates a directory named "myebsvolume" in the /mnt directory. You can choose any directory as the mount point for the EBS volume. Adjust the directory path (/mnt/myebsvolume) to your desired location.

>> sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/myebsvolume: This command mounts the EBS volume specified by /dev/xvdf to the /mnt/myebsvolume directory. Again, adjust the device name and mount point path as needed.

>> ls /mnt/myebsvolume: After mounting the EBS volume, this command lists the contents of the mount point directory (/mnt/myebsvolume). It helps you verify that the volume has been successfully mounted.

>> sudo nano /etc/fstab: This command opens the /etc/fstab file in the Nano text editor. The /etc/fstab file contains information about file systems and their mount points, including entries for automatically mounting volumes at boot time.

>> /dev/xvdf /mnt/myebsvolume ext4 defaults,nofail 0 2: This entry is added to the /etc/fstab file. It specifies the device (/dev/xvdf), the mount point (/mnt/myebsvolume), the file system type (ext4), mount options (defaults,nofail), and two numbers (0 and 2) that control the file system check order and backup options.

By adding this entry to the /etc/fstab file, the EBS volume will be automatically mounted at system boot, ensuring its persistence across reboots.
