******** Explaination ****************



The provided code snippet is a Jenkins Declarative Pipeline script. It defines a Jenkins pipeline with two stages: "Build-Maven" and "Deploy-Tomcat". Let's go through the script step by step:

pipeline: This keyword marks the beginning of the pipeline block.

agent any: This specifies that the pipeline can be executed on any available agent (slave). It means the pipeline can run on any available Jenkins agent.

tools: This block is used to define the tools or software versions needed for the pipeline. In this case, it specifies that the Maven version 'maven-3.9.2' should be used. Jenkins will automatically download and configure this version of Maven for the pipeline.

stages: This block contains the different stages of the pipeline.

stage ('Build-Maven'): This defines the first stage of the pipeline, named "Build-Maven".

steps: This block contains the steps to be executed within the stage.

sh ''' ... ''': This is a shell (bash) step, indicated by sh. It executes the shell commands within the triple quotes. In this case, it changes the directory to ./maven/simple-war/, runs the mvn clean package command to clean and package the Maven project, changes the directory to ./target/, and lists the files using the ls command.

stage ('Deploy-Tomcat'): This defines the second stage of the pipeline, named "Deploy-Tomcat".

steps: This block contains the steps to be executed within the stage.

script: This block allows for the execution of scripted pipeline syntax within the declarative pipeline. It provides more flexibility to include custom logic or scripted steps.

deploy: This step deploys the war file to a Tomcat server. It specifies the deployment details, such as the Tomcat URL, credentials for authentication, context path, and the path to the WAR file to be deployed.

The provided script builds a Maven project, generates a WAR file, and deploys it to a Tomcat server using Jenkins.
